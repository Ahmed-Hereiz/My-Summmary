# My Summary To Famous Python Libraries

### Here Iam summarizing what I learned on many libraries... Which helps me while coding <br>Where I take the code I need from here and only depug it as I need for my project (so that helped me alot)
### Data I used are from many sources (datacamp courses or csv files I have on my computer)

# Content :
> - matplotlib basics (contains basics of matplotlib)
> - matplotlib using subplots (focused on making subplots for visualizing)
> - seaborn basics (basics of what I learned on seaborn)
> - seaborn more visuealizing (more visualizations usnig seaborn)
> - data cleaning (many data cleaning concepts I learned)
> - EDA (notebook for many things I learned using pandas, matplotlib,seaborn)
> - pillow (basics of pillow library)
> - pytesserect basics (contains only basics of pytesserect)

# I am currently working on : 
> - Making another pillow notebook
> - Making another notebook for Pytesserect
> - Notebook for openCV
> - Notebook for numpy
> - Notebook for scipy
> - Notebook for sklearn

# I intend to Make : 
> - Notebook for sympy
> - Notebook for pytorch (I am trying to learn it first...)
